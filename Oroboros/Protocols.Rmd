### Mitochondrial isolation (Krumschnabel et al, 2014)

Mitochondrial isolation medium for mouse brain mitochondria: 320 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM
TRIS, pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl (25 °C).  

STEPS:
  1. Dissect the brain from the mouse skull and place immediately in ice-cold MiR05.  
  2. Determine wet weight (Ww [mg]).  
  3. Transfer brain to a pre-cooled glass beaker (20 ml) and wash twice with ice-cold MiR05.  
  4. Mince the tissue into small pieces using a pair of sharp scissors and suspend with 5
volume Ww ice-cold MiR05.  
  5. Transfer to a pre-cooled glass/Teflon potter and homogenize the tissue with 8 strokes at
1,000 rpm.  
  6. Transfer the homogenate to 20 ml of ice-cold mitochondrial isolation medium with 2.5
mg BSA/ml.  
  7. Centrifuge at 1000 g for 10 min at 4 °C.  
  8. Transfer the supernatant into new tube and centrifuge at 6,200 g for 10 min at 4 °C.  
  9. Discard the supernatant and wash mitochondrial pellet with ice-cold mitochondrial
isolation medium.  
  10. Re-suspend mitochondria in a small volume of MiR05 (~ 200 μl/brain).  
  11. Store isolated mitochondria on ice until use.
