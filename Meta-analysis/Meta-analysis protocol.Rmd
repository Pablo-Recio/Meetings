### **Objectives and main question**

<div style="text-align: justify"> The main objective of the meta-analysis is to examine how elevation of GCs during embryonic development affects learning abilities: **Does prenatal exposure to GCs affect learning?**  
To do so, I need to identify studies that conducted some GCs-related manipulation on dams or eggs before hatchling and then measured learning abilities. More specifically, I will use studies testing the differences in learning performance of offspring coming from dams or eggs treated with GCs or submitted to any kind of stressor versus a control group.  

In addition, I will also aim to test the influence of incubation temperature on prenatal GCs effects: **Does the incubation temperature influence the effect of GCs-related treatment?**  
For that - if the amount of studies is enough -, I will examine the impact of early thermal environment by employing only those studies that include the incubation temperature of eggs and investigating the relationship between temperature and GCsâ€™ effect. </div>

    Finally, I combined all the searches (Search > Search history > Combine queries) 
  - RESULTS: **1,528** papers  
</details>  

  * *Other searches*:  
  Together with the search on both databases, I search those papers in the metadata from Eyck et al. 2019 (*Biol Rev*) where learning or cognition was measured as the main trait (**12** papers)
  

### **Papers downloaded and duplicated studies**

  * After obtaining all the references, I created a library on EndNote 20 (*Meta-analysis.enl*), combined all the references in one list and got rid of duplicates (Library>Find Duplicates).  
  Total number of duplicates: 931  
    - RESULTS: **4,288** papers  

### **Rayyan process**

  <summary style=font-size:15px> Importing a library from NoteEnd and preliminary screening </summary>  

  1. Export file from EndNote selecting **Output style 'Refman (RIS) Export'**  
  2. Import to RAYYAN by using command **Select files**  
  3. Then, use the decision tree (see 'Selection criteria' in 'Screening papers section') to screen through at least 100 papers to see how many can be included  
    - RESULTS: **8 included/112 screened**

* Selection criteria: ![Decision tree](./Decision_tree.png)
  
* Concepts in decision tree:  
  + **Definitions and examples of CORT and stressors:**
    - Other synonyms of CORT are Corticosterone, Cortisol, Glucocorticoids (GCs)  
    - Some procedures considered stressors in rats: learned helplessness, the forced swimming test, the tail suspension test, isolation, chronic mild stress, and sleep deprivation  
    - We will consider a stressor anything else that is stated as a stressor directly by the authors  
    - If there is a treatment but we do not know if it can be stressful or not, then is a "Don't know" (see decision tree)  
  + **Definitions and examples of learning:**  
    - Memory or cognition can be used as synonyms  
    - Spatial or associative tasks can be synonyms of learning  
    - ALso, another learning test usually used with rats is the Morris-water task/water task  
  + **What is a "mutant strain" of mice/rats?**  
    - In some papers, they use laboratory reared strains of mice or rats that may be more sensitive to CORT or the stressor used; unless they also use a 'wild-type' mice, we will exclude those papers
